# OMR-Evaluation
Overview
This project focuses on developing an Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) system using Python that automates the grading of multiple-choice answer sheets. The system captures an image of the answer sheet using a webcam, processes the image using image processing techniques, and evaluates the answers against a predefined answer key. The results are displayed in an easy-to-read format using data visualization tools like Pandas and Matplotlib.

Need for the Project
Manual grading is time-consuming: Grading multiple-choice answer sheets manually can take a lot of time and is prone to human error.

Efficiency in academic evaluations: With institutions conducting exams for hundreds or thousands of students, an automated system can significantly speed up the evaluation process.

Error reduction: Human graders may inadvertently make errors while checking answers. Automating this task ensures a higher level of accuracy and consistency.

Cost-effective: Traditional OMR systems rely on expensive hardware and software. Developing a Python-based solution can be a cost-effective alternative for smaller institutions or individuals.

Customization and flexibility: A Python-based system allows users to customize and tweak the application according to their needs, such as altering the layout of OMR sheets, handling different formats, or adding advanced analytics.
